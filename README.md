# Smalledit

Barebones text editor with only essential functions.

This project was created as part of the NPRG035 Programming in C# at the
Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University.

> This is NOT a full fledged editor for every day use, especially for large files. The library used does not implement
> optimizations needed for a snappy editor like Vim, etc.

## Before you install

Smalledit was tested on (Arch) Linux and Windows 11 and should work without
issues on these platforms.

## Running the app

To build Smalledit, run `dotnet build`. To run it, execute `dotnet run`.

Information about all features of Smalledit can be found in the [User manual](docs/MANUAL.md).
